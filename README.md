**DocSurf** is the default file manager of **SynOS**, built as a modern, beautiful, and fast Qt-based alternative to Dolphin. Designed with the flair of the Atmo design language and a commitment to elegant human-centric design, DocSurf aims to make file navigation not only powerful, but also deeply enjoyable.

Currently in **very early alpha**, DocSurf is a **work in progress** and is actively being developed to reflect the design philosophy of Syndromatic: clarity, charm, and control.

## üöß Project Status
    ‚ö†Ô∏è DocSurf is currently in very early alpha.
    While it compiles and runs, many components such as toolbar UI,
    full menu integration, and advanced view modes (like Cover Flow) are incomplete or experimental. Retina Display support is also currently lacklustre.

Expect bugs, unfinished features, and rough edges. We welcome collaboration and testing, but this is not ready for production use.

## üôè Credits
DocSurf is a modified and actively maintained fork of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kdfm/">KDFM</a>, an open-source file manager originally developed by Robert Metsaranta. Immense gratitude to Robert for his excellent foundational work.

## üß† Philosophy & Goals
DocSurf is more than just a file manager. It embodies a design rebellion against bland utility. We believe your file explorer should spark joy, nostalgia, and control without sacrificing power.
As a keystone of the SynOS Atmo design language ecosystem, DocSurf will continue to evolve toward a full-featured, skeuomorphic, and deeply human file browsing experience.
